<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>Some apology is perhaps needed from one who can neither
claim to be a classical scholar nor a professional arch&aelig;ologist
in venturing upon the subject of these lectures.</p>
<p>Repeated visits to Greece and the Greek colonies
during the past twenty years have enabled the author to
observe, in their various stages, certain of the researches
to be here briefly recounted. To him their interest appeared
so considerable that it seemed probable the enquiry might
be attractive to members of the medical profession generally,
and perhaps also to other readers, from the side of the
cult, if not from that of the classical arch&aelig;ologist.</p>
<p>The same motive explains the effort made to present a
picture, in part hypothetical, of the ancient fabrics, and of
the work carried on in them. More latitude in speculation
in such a direction is perhaps allowable to one who traces
the development of a cult, than to the scientific arch&aelig;ologist.</p>
<p>No originality is claimed in regard to the facts. Some
of the sketches and restorations are original, and so are
various theories or suggested explanations, such as that
regarding the purpose of the Tholos and the Circular Pit
at the Asklepieion;  the suggestion that the Square Building
was a Prytaneion, where sacrificial banquets were held and
<span class="pb" id="Page_ii">ii</span>
the perpetual fire maintained; the theory that certain of the
buildings were hostels; the conjecture regarding the selection
of sites for Greek Theatres, &amp;c. Whether these are well-founded
or otherwise only time and further research can
decide.</p>
<p>The author desires to record his thanks to the learned
Oxford friend who edited and translated the inscription on
<a href="#Page_42">page 42</a>, and who kindly pointed out various errors in the
first issue, also to Mr. Sampson, the librarian of University
College, Liverpool, for his highly valued advice and for his
kindness in reading the proofs of the present edition.</p>

<p>You are aware that during the last twenty-five years
the energy and enthusiasm in arch&aelig;ological research of such
men as Dr. Schliemann have not merely thrown light on
historic and prehistoric Greece, but have also awakened a keener
enthusiasm among classical scholars and in those Societies which
in various countries are devoted to arch&aelig;ological investigation.
Even Governments have been influenced and induced to help
on the progress of these highly interesting studies. The
Germans have spent large sums in the excavation of Olympia
and Pergamos. The French government has wisely and
liberally incurred a considerable expenditure in the excavation
of Delphi and on other important works. The Greek Government,
aided by members of the Greek Arch&aelig;ological Society,
has devoted money and an infinitude of labour to investigations
of the classic wealth of Greece and the Greek colonies.</p>
<p>In these three instances, although the amount paid may be
trivial when viewed in the national balance-sheet, its arch&aelig;ological
equivalent is great. These three countries have not
only made the whole world their debtor by the liberality they
have displayed, but each has quickened and stimulated a taste
for learning and for art among its own people.</p>
<p>One or two other nationalities have had a share in the
progress made, though of a more private and individual kind.
The American School has explored the Argive Her&aelig;on and
certain other classical sites, and our own British School in
Athens, whose chief wealth has been the enthusiasm of its
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
members, has done much, when we consider the difficulties to
be met and the lack of that sufficient pecuniary support with
which other countries have endowed their representatives.</p>
<p>Although considerable interest is felt by the English
public in regard to much of the work just referred to, one
important field of investigation has remained comparatively
unknown in this country&mdash;I mean the exploration of the shrines
of Asklepios, the god of healing, at Epidauros and Athens,
about which I am to have the honour of speaking to you. As
the time allotted is brief, it is needful to avoid all prefatory
remarks, and to restrict this paper almost entirely to a
consideration of the new discoveries and to inferences from
them. As a matter of fact, apart from the Hippocratic
writings there is but scant information as to the sanitary and
medical aspects of Greek life in ancient literature. Homer and
Pindar have brief references to Epidauros and other sanctuaries
of the god; so also have Plato, Hippys of Regium, Strabo,
and some of the dramatists, as Aristophanes, and certain of the
late Greek writers, especially Pausanias. Under these circumstances
most precious are the researches made by the spade.</p>
<p>The pioneer in this inquiry was M. Cavvadias, the eminent
arch&aelig;ologist, Ephor of Antiquities and late Minister of
Education in the Greek government. To him more than to
any one else we owe the important additions lately made to this
branch of arch&aelig;ology.</p>
<p>He worked in conjunction with the Greek Arch&aelig;ological
Society, and was aided by M. Sta&iuml;s, the Conservator of the
National Museum. Herr Baunack and others helped to
restore and decipher the hundreds of inscriptions which
were found&mdash;a work of no small difficulty.</p>
<p>Various authorities more or less associated with the
French School, such as M. G&eacute;rard, MM. Defrasse and Lechat,
and Prof. Reinach; Dr. D&ouml;rpfeld, Prof. Furtw&auml;ngler, Herr
Baunack, Dr. K&ouml;chler, and others associated with the German
School, have had a share in the work or in recording its
results.</p>
<p>Comparatively little has been done by the English, and
only a limited amount of description has been published in our
language. An interesting paper by Professor Percy Gardner,
in his <i>New Chapters in Greek History</i>, some valuable references
by Miss Jane Harrison and Mrs. Verrall in their <i>Mythology and
Monuments of Ancient Athens</i>, the admirable notes in Mr.
Frazer&rsquo;s new edition of <i>Pausanias</i>, and one or two articles in
American journals, such as the <i>American Antiquarian</i> and
<i>Cornell Studies</i>, are among the chief.</p>

<p>I have to express my acknowledgment to the authorities
I have named, but chiefly to M. Cavvadias for his kindness in
giving me special facilities in Greece, and for allowing me the
use of some of his plates; also to MM. Defrasse and Lechat,

their beautiful restorations. Apart from these the lantern

<h3 id="c3">I. <span class="sc">The Hieron of Epidauros</span></h3>
<p>According to tradition, Asklepios, the son of Apollo and
Koronis, was born in the Hieron valley, in the Argolic peninsula;
the place names still preserve the legend; the hamlet of
Koroni commemorates his mother, the hill Titthion owes its
name to his having been there suckled by a goat, while on the
opposite hill, Kynortion, stood the temple of the Maleatean
Apollo.</p>
<p>The Hieron six miles from the town of Epidauros was
the chief seat of the worship of Asklepios, though minor ones
existed in Athens, at Delphi, Pergamos, Troizen, Kos, Trikke,
and other places.</p>
<p><a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> is an outline restoration, representing some of the
principal buildings in the Hieron.</p>
<p>I must warn the reader that this plan does not profess to be
accurate. The structural detail of the buildings is always more
or less conjectural, even their relative size and their distances
from one another are only approximately correct. The object
of the plan is to give a general idea of the arrangement of the
chief buildings hitherto discovered, exclusive of the theatre.
(It should be stated here that the numbers which follow refer
to the illustrations, while the capital letters correspond with
those on <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p><i>A</i> represents the gateway or Propyl&aelig;a (or perhaps temple
of Hygieia) on the south of the precinct. Its close relation to
the quadrangle <i>B</i> has caused some observers to suppose it was
the entrance to <i>B</i> alone, but to the writer this seems improbable.</p>
<p><i>B</i> is a large quadrangle about 250 feet square, reminding
one of the Pal&aelig;stra at Olympia. The central space was
surrounded by small rooms and a colonnade; some of the
columns of the latter remain, embedded in the later Roman
brickwork of a music hall or Odeon, constructed within the
quadrangle. Nine rows of seats and part of the stage of the
Odeon still remain. The building has been supposed to be
a gymnasium; but if so, must have ceased to be the scene of
gymnastic exercises after the quadrangle was built upon in
Roman times. Was it a hostel?</p>

<p>Within the temple stood, as shown in Defrasse&rsquo;s drawing,
<a href="#fig6">Plate VI</a>, the great chryselephantine statue of Asklepios made
by Thrasymedes of Paros, a work somewhat resembling the
Parthenon figure, or the vast Zeus of Olympia, or the Hera at
the Argive Her&aelig;on; the flesh was ivory, the rest gold
splendidly enamelled in colours. So many small replicas of
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
this figure remain&mdash;sculptured copies found at Epidauros, or
small representations on ancient coins&mdash;that by the aid of
Pausanias&rsquo; description M. Defrasse has doubtless reproduced
the image with a near approach to accuracy.</p>
<p>The god was sitting on a throne, a large golden serpent
rising up to his left hand; on his right lay a dog, and in front
was an altar.</p>

<p class="pcap">PLATE VI&mdash;<span class="sc">Restoration of chryselephantine figure of Asklepios</span>
(Defrasse)</p>
</div>
<p>Gold and ivory were beautiful materials for the sculptor,
though involving much difficulty when combined. The
disappearance of all attempts at chryselephantine sculpture in
modern times is perhaps due to this difficulty in production
and to the cost, but probably more to the fact that the ivory
usually tended to crack. The great figure of Athena in the
Parthenon needed, we know, to be frequently moistened on its
ivory surface with water. At Olympia, oil was applied to the
great figure of Zeus, but curiously enough the Asklepios at
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Epidauros needed neither. As the god of medicine, it may be
supposed that he was able to preserve his own integument, but
Pausanias tells us that a well, beneath the pavement of the
temple, diffused sufficient moisture to prevent contraction and
cracking of the ivory.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>On the throne were representations, doubtless in relief, of
Bellerophon killing the Chim&aelig;ra, and of Perseus with the head
of the Medusa.</p>

<p class="pcap">PLATE VII&mdash;<span class="sc">Base of Temple of Asklepios</span></p>

exist to-day. Fragments of column, capital, pediment, &amp;c.,
with pavements and bases of walls, render the hypothetical
reconstruction of the building fairly easy.</p>
<p><i>D D</i> in my first illustration is the Ionic portico or
Abaton, a part of which is seen in Plates <a href="#fig5">V.</a> and <a href="#fig10">X.</a>; the
western part is in two stories, the lower one being in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
basement. It is open on the south side; a double colonnade
supports the roof, the eaves of which, together with the walls
and columns, showed colour decoration. This constituted the
ward or sleeping place for the sick who were awaiting the
miraculous interposition of the god. The Abaton was
furnished with pallets, lamps, tables, altars, and probably
curtains, the patients themselves supplying their own bed
clothing. Other details of this building will be given in the
next lecture. It may be added here that from one point of
view these remains are highly interesting, for they constitute
the earliest known example of a Hospital Ward. There is
reason to believe that institutions closely related to Infirmaries
or Hospitals existed in Egypt many centuries earlier than the
founding of the Hieron, but no structural trace of such a
building has been discovered.</p>

<p class="pcap">PLATE IX&mdash;<span class="sc">Remains of lower story of West Abaton</span></p>
</div>
<p>The Tholos or Thymele, shown at <i>E</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> and in the
annexed restoration by Defrasse, <a href="#fig10">Plate X</a>, was probably the
most beautiful circular temple that the Greeks ever built, far
surpassing the Philippeion at Olympia. It was built in the
fourth century <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, by Polykleitos the younger, and took
twenty-one years to build; externally it presented a beautiful
doric colonnade, with peculiarly rich cornice, coloured. Within
was a circle of sixteen graceful Corinthian columns of marble;
the wall and floor were also decorated with variously coloured
marbles. Here were two celebrated paintings by Pausias, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Greek artist; the first represented Methe (drunkenness), a
woman holding a large wine goblet to her lips, the glass of
which was so painted that the face was seen through, or
reflected in it. The second, a picture of Eros (love) laying
aside his bow and quiver and taking up his lyre, a less
dangerous weapon. Perhaps we may suppose that the painter
here indicated the relation of Bacchus and Venus to the ailments
which afflict mankind. The scourges which we are told the
gods make out of the pleasant vices of men doubtless often
brought the wealthy Greek as a suppliant to Asklepios.</p>

<p class="pcap">PLATE X&mdash;<span class="sc">Restoration of Tholos</span> (Defrasse)</p>
</div>
<p>What was the purpose of the Tholos? Defrasse and
Lechat believe it was a drinking-fountain, a sort of pump-room,
in which in old times a healing spring arose; if so, we
can imagine the gouty Athenian being sent here to drink large
draughts from the holy spring, he envying meanwhile Methe
and her occupation on the wall before him. The foundations
are curious, consisting of a series of circular walls forming a
labyrinth, every part of which must necessarily be traversed by
the explorer seeking the central space, <a href="#fig11">Plate XI</a>.</p>

<p class="pcap">PLATE XI&mdash;<span class="sc">Foundation of Tholos</span></p>
</div>
<p>MM. Defrasse and Lechat think this singularly constructed
basement was a water cistern from which the &lsquo;pump-room&rsquo;
above was supplied. The difficulties attending this rather
attractive hypothesis are&mdash;(<i>a</i>) that the word &lsquo;Thymele&rsquo; means
a sacrificing place; (<i>b</i>) Pausanias speaks of the Tholos and of
the sacred well as though they were entirely distinct places;
(<i>c</i>) after careful search I can find no trace of a water conduit;
(<i>d</i>) the basement space, I may say confidently, was not
cemented, either on wall or floor, as in all probability it would
have been if to hold water. Not improbably the Tholos was
employed for minor sacrifices, and perhaps the labyrinth below
may have been associated with some mysterious Asklepian rite
of which we are now ignorant; <i>e.g.</i>, the labyrinth may have
been the home of the sacred serpents. We do not know what
were the domestic economics of these creatures; they, in an
especial degree, were the incarnation of the god. They were
treated by the sick with the utmost veneration; perhaps this
curious basement structure was their retreat, and conceivably
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the upper stage of the Tholos was employed for the offering of
sacrifices to them as representatives of the god. Perhaps the
sacrificial cakes (<span title="popana" class="g">&pi;&#8057;&pi;&alpha;&nu;&alpha;</span>) were here offered to them. An
aperture in the floor may have been provided allowing the
passage of the serpents from the labyrinth to the sacrificing
place above. We know that the sick were in the habit of
offering these cakes to the serpents as a matter of common
usage.</p>

<p class="pcap">PLATE XII&mdash;<span class="sc">Restoration of Temple of Artemis</span> (R.C.)</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig1">Plate I</a>, Letter <i>F</i>. The Temple of Artemis is smaller than
that of Asklepios (see <a href="#fig12">Plate XII</a>); the eaves were decorated by
a rich cornice of sculptured heads of dogs, the attribute of
Artemis-Hekate. She, the sister of Apollo, was a divinity of
healing and succour, the chaste moon goddess, who healed
&AElig;neas. Acroteria of Victories decorated the eastern gable;
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
within was a row of marble columns, and externally stood a
triple figure of Artemis-Hekate, and an altar.</p>
<p>Letter <i>G</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> shows the position of the grove,
which probably extended also in the direction of the Tholos.
<i>H</i> in the same plate shows the position of an altar which may
have been sacred either to Asklepios or to Artemis. The letter
<i>I</i> shows a foundation on which probably a much larger altar
formerly stood; it may have been that of Asklepios, on which
possibly holocausts were offered. <i>J</i> represents the southern
boundary of the precinct. &beta; is thought to have been the shrine of
the <span title="Epidotai" class="g">&#7960;&pi;&iota;&delta;&#8057;&tau;&alpha;&iota;</span>
or bountiful gods.</p>
<p><i>K</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> represents the square building which has
occasioned much discussion. It contains the base of an altar
surrounded by many bones of sacrificial animals and much ash,
also fragments of bronze and earthenware, many of them
bearing dedications to Apollo or Asklepios. Its period of
erection seems to have been not later than the beginning of the
fifth century <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> It contained great numbers of statues and
inscriptions. It may have been a house for priests or officials,
or even a hostel, or possibly was the Prytaneion, on the
altar of which burnt the perpetual fire; no mention is, however,
made of a Prytaneion in the inscriptions.</p>
<p><i>L</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> represents a large building, irregular,
and of various date; believed to have been the baths of
Asklepios; this building perhaps may have also contained
the library, dedicated to the Maleatean Apollo and Asklepios,
which one would think is likely to have been in some central
position.</p>
<p><i>M</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> is intended to represent a rectangular
building of which only small traces remain. Whether or not it
was a definitely constructed quadrangle, such as I have drawn,
may be uncertain. If it was, perhaps we have here the remains
of one of the two gymnasia which the inscriptions tell us
existed at the Hieron, or it may have contained baths.</p>
<p><i>N</i> in the same plate is a restoration of the building with
the four quadrangles, only lately excavated. It is the largest
building yet discovered at the Hieron, being nearly 90 yards
square. Each of the four quadrangles is surrounded by a
number of rooms. In all there were between seventy and
eighty of these apartments, each of which opened into its
own quadrangle, so far as I could judge. A colonnade ran
round the interior of each quadrangle. Query, what is it?&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
gymnasium, a pal&aelig;stra, a college for the priests, or a great
hostel? I confess the last-named seems the most probable.
When one considers the large number of the sick who came to
the Hieron, it is obvious that extensive accommodation must
have been provided for them somewhere. The two chambers
of the abaton could not have held more than 120 beds,
supposing these to have been placed in two rows; or if we
suppose the almost dark lower story of the western end to
have been a dormitory also, 180 would then have been the
greatest possible accommodation. This, if the extreme number
to be entertained, scarcely accords with the accounts given
by ancient writers of the multitudes who came for healing to
the sanctuary. It appears likely, therefore, that this and other
undetermined buildings were hostels for the accommodation of
those whose ailments were slight or who were convalescent.</p>

that &alpha; is the temple of Asklepios and the Egyptian Apollo.</p>
<p><i>P</i> is a building also of the Roman Period, and evidently
contained baths. There are traces of a hypocaust. The
remains of hot air or hot water pipes are abundant, and certain
curious apse-like recesses in the walls, containing a seat and
terminating below in a bath or deep basin, were evidently a
form of sitzbath. When we remember that the French have
lately discovered at Delphi no less than three extensive bathing
establishments, adjacent to the walls of the precinct on the east,
west, and south sides respectively, it is not surprising that we
should find at least two such buildings at Epidauros. A part of
this Roman bath-house is seen in the distance in <a href="#fig13">Plate XIII</a>.</p>

<p class="pcap">PLATE XIV&mdash;<span class="sc">Figure of Aphrodite</span></p>
</div>
<p><i>Q</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> is a quadrangular building between the Temple
of Artemis and the South Portal. Round three if not four of
its sides were rooms, as in the case of the great four-quadrangle
building; many remains of columns are seen. Its purpose is
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
doubtful. Probably it is the Colonnade of Kotys which
Pausanias mentions. (It is to be hoped that no shrine of the
dissolute Thracian goddess of that name existed here.)</p>
<p>This Colonnade of Kotys we know was originally built of
sun-dried brick, and may perhaps originally have had wooden
columns. Sun-dried brick, so common in many parts of
Greece to-day, was often used in ancient times for important
purposes, as, for example, in the building of the Her&aelig;on at
Olympia. When this somewhat perishable material was covered
with a fine hard cement, which resisted the heaviest rain, walls
so constructed became wonderfully durable. The Colonnade
of Kotys was rebuilt during Roman times. Some of the roof
tiles discovered lately bear the name of Antoninus. Cavvadias
suggests that the small temple &gamma; is that of Themis.</p>
<p><i>R</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> is a colonnade which extended east and west
nearly at right angles with the Roman Baths <i>P</i> described above.
<a href="#fig13">Plate XIII</a> shows the remains of this colonnade, also a small
open aqueduct with basins in its course about eleven yards
apart. This small water channel reminds the visitor of a
similar one existing in front of the Echo Colonnade at Olympia,
the latter contains one or two basins like those shown in the
plate. This view shows in the distance the Roman baths (<i>P</i>).</p>
<p>Adjoining this colonnade on the north-east is a large
quadrangle <i>S</i>, formerly bordered on its four sides by columns.
Its length east and west was about double its breadth north
and south. Was this another hostel?</p>
<p><i>T</i> is believed by M. Cavvadias to be the Temple of
Aphrodite, a Doric structure only excavated in 1892. An
inscription discovered on the spot speaks of the sanctuary of
Aphrodite; not far from it was found a statue of the goddess
in Parian marble, a most beautiful figure now preserved in the
Museum at Athens. <a href="#fig14">Plate XIV</a> is an attempt to represent
this figure as it now exists. The ancient cemetery of the
Hieron was near the point marked &epsilon; in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a>.</p>
<p><i>U</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> is an Ionic building, the present condition of
which is shown in <a href="#fig15">Plate XV</a>. It may be a temple external
to the precinct, or it may, as others suggest, be the Northern
Propyl&aelig;a or Ceremonial Gateway. The latter appears the
more probable explanation; by this entrance the pilgrims
who came from the port of Epidaurus would approach the
Sanctuary. Note the small well in the foreground.</p>
<p><i>V</i> is a Roman building of unknown purpose, and <i>W</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>

has yet to be found. It will be noted that, as at Olympia,
many important buildings are external to the precinct.</p>

<p>The Great Theatre situated to the south of the precinct
was built about the year 450 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> by Polykleitos, the architect
of the Tholos. Pausanias, who was a great traveller, tells us it
was the most interesting of all the theatres existing in his time,
and to-day any one who is familiar with the theatres of Greece
and the Greek colonies will say that this is more impressive
than any of the others. The Koilon or auditorium consisted of
fifty-five rows of marble seats, with twenty-four lines of stairs.
The space for the chorus is, according to the ancient system,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
circular, and in the centre doubtless stood an altar of Bacchus.
The stage was elevated nearly twelve feet, the proscenium being
enriched by splendid sculpture. The acoustics of the theatre
are perfect; a sound little louder than a whisper uttered on the
stage can be heard in every part. The theatre is so placed on
the slope of Kynortion that the occupants of the major part of
the auditorium had a charming view (over the top of the stage)
of the mountains to the north and of the whole range of
beautiful buildings of the Hieron.</p>

<p><a href="#fig17">Plate XVII</a> represents the view taken from the top row of

quadrangle building,&rdquo; and glimpses of the Hieron beyond.
While witnessing here the sublime tragedies of &AElig;schylus or
Sophocles, or such a comedy as the <i>Plutus</i> of Aristophanes (in
which, as you will remember, great fun is made at the expense
of Asklepios and his priests), the contrast afforded by glancing
from the stage to the blues and purples of the mountains, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
verdancy of the grove, and the beautiful forms and colours of
the group of temples would be most pleasing. The Greeks
were acute in perceiving and taking advantage of subtle sources
of pleasure like this, and I believe that the sites of many of
their theatres were chosen so as to secure for the audience this
double pleasure. The Theatre of Delphi is a conspicuous
example of this provision, as also is that of Tauromena. This
theatre has been said to seat 12,000 spectators; according to
my own rough computation, it unquestionably will hold over
9,000 without crowding.</p>

<p>Before quitting this theatre it may be remarked that Dr.
D&ouml;rpfeld&rsquo;s interesting and attractive theory of the occupancy
of orchestra and stage equally by the players in a Greek drama,
is difficult of application in this individual case, in consequence
of the great difference in level&mdash;eleven or twelve feet&mdash;between
the two. So great a disparity of surface would, as most people
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
think, seriously interfere with the unity of the representation,
even if flights of steps connected orchestra and stage.</p>
<p><i>X</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> represents part of the Stadium, which is about
six hundred feet long. Here are remains of at least fifteen
rows of marble seats. Probably foot races took place here as
well as other forms of athletic exercise. All the maps of the
Hieron represent the eastern end of the Stadium as semicircular,
but so far as one can judge, the latest excavations indicate that
it was square, and therefore I have so represented it.</p>

<p>Assuming that the fifteen rows of seats extended from end
to end on each side, and allowing a foot and a half for each
person, the Stadium would seat twelve thousand spectators on
its two sides, without computing the seats at the ends.</p>
<p><a href="#fig18">Plate XVIII</a> represents the excavation at the end adjacent
to the Hieron. <i>Y</i> in <a href="#fig1">Plate I</a> (shown also in <a href="#fig18">Plate XVIII</a>) is

passage probably communicating with the precinct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>An inscription (found in 1896) mentioned by Mr. Frazer,
shows that a hippodrome also existed at the Hieron.</p>
<p>On Mount Kynortion, some distance south of the great
theatre, stood the temple of the Maleatean Apollo. The
remains are so fragmentary that it is difficult to devise a
conjectural restoration.</p>
<h3 id="c4">II. <span class="sc">The Asklepieion at Athens</span></h3>
<p>Before saying anything about the ritual and the treatment
of the sick at the Hieron, it will be well to turn to the
Asklepieion at Athens, and examine briefly the structural
arrangements there. Situated on the south side of the Acropolis,
at an elevation of perhaps eighty feet above the plain, adjoining
on the east the theatre of Dionysus, the locality was probably
as healthy as any the immediate neighbourhood of Athens
could supply. The heat no doubt was great in summer, but
we may conclude that a grove of large trees afforded grateful
shade to the sick.</p>

the extreme left is seen the temple of the Nike Apteros, and on
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
the summit of the Akropolis the Parthenon. Between the Stoa
and the rock of the Akropolis is situated the Asklepieion. The
accompanying outline plan, <a href="#fig20">No. XX</a>, is an attempt to give
some idea of the arrangement of buildings within the precinct.
The buildings were to a certain extent an imitation, on a smaller
scale, and on a limited area, of those at the Hieron of
Epidauros. Remains of what were probably a temple of
Asklepios and Hygieia, of doric architecture, also a supposed
temple of Themis, and a shrine of Isis, exist, while smaller
shrines of Serapis, Kore, Hypnos, Herakles, Panakia, Demeter,
and other divinities have left no distinct traces. There are
considerable remains of a large eastern portico or abaton of
pentelic marble, from which is reached a circular chamber in
the rock containing the sacred well. Some of the masonry
here seems to me to be of late Roman date.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
inscribed &ldquo;western abaton&rdquo; in <a href="#fig20">plan No. XX</a> may have been
a supplementary abaton or a priest&rsquo;s house or a covered
gymnasium. A grove existed, perhaps occupying the space
between the Stoa of Eumenes and the temples, or situated in
a large vacant space to the west.</p>
<p>On an elevation above and close to the abaton is a curious
well-like structure, surrounded by marble columns, which
perhaps was the serpent pit.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">

<p class="pcap">PLATE XXIII&mdash;<span class="sc">Supposed Serpent Pit and remains of Marbled

</div>
<p><a href="#fig23">Plate No. XXIII</a> represents the remains of this curious
and mysterious structure. I examined the masonry carefully to
see if a direct communication between this supposed snake pit
and the abaton could be traced, but failed to find it. If the
purpose of the Tholos at Epidauros is that suggested above,
viz., a place of sacrifice to the sacred serpents, may we not have
here also the remains of a Tholos or Thymele on a small scale?
Possibly the four marble bases are those of columns surrounding
an altar to which the serpents ascended from their pit beneath,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
to receive the sacrificial cakes of the worshippers, who
themselves stood beneath a roof carried by these columns.
This of course is a mere hypothesis.</p>
<p>The grove contained great numbers of statues, busts,
ex-votos, and inscriptions. The theatre of Dionysos close at
hand was doubtless frequented by the sick as a diversion. The
stall occupied by the priest of Asklepios, with his name on it, is
still in excellent preservation, as seen in <a href="#fig24">plate XXIV</a>. He sat
in the first rank, in a most honoured position, with his back to
the setting sun, next to the priest of the Muses. The
Panathenaic stadium, three-quarters of a mile away, doubtless
was also frequently visited by the convalescents from the
Asklepieion.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">LECTURE II</span></h2>
<p>We now pass on to consider the ritual of the Asklepian shrines
and the accommodation and treatment of the sick who frequented
them.</p>
<p>It is convenient, first, to consider the Hierarchy. They
consisted of the Hiereus or Hierophant, the priest, who was the
head official. He was appointed annually, and he appears to
have been frequently re-elected. From the Athenian inscriptions
we know that sometimes he was a physician, sometimes not;
so also it was with the subordinate officials. The priest was the
general administrator, and had a share in the financial government
of the temple. The Dadouchoi, or torch-bearers, were
probably subordinate priests; the Pyrophoroi, or fire-carriers,
among other functions, lighted the sacred fire on the altars; the
Nakoroi or Zakoroi, whose duties in the temple are uncertain,
sometimes were physicians; the Kleidouchoi, or key-bearers,
who perhaps were originally a class of superior door porters,
but who appear later to have assumed priestly functions; the
Hieromnemones seem to have had purely secular duties, and in
common with the Hiereus had charge of all receipts and payments;
all were under the rule of the Boule of Epidauros.
The Kanephoroi (or basket-bearers) and the Arrephoroi (or
carriers of mysteries or holy things) were priestesses. We read
in some of the inscriptions of servants or attendants who
ministered to the sick, and carried those who were unable to
walk. Did these women in any degree act as nurses? It is
possible, but no definite information on the subject is given.</p>
<p>There were certain officials, also, who attended to the sacred
dogs; the serpents are not thus far known to have had such
guardians. We read also of bath attendants.</p>
<p>There was also a special religious society termed the
Asklepiastai.</p>
<p>Turning now from the priests to the suppliants: these, we
find, came from all parts of the Greek world, and from what
ancient writers tell us their numbers appear to have been great.
Where were they housed? Some, of course, dwelt in the
abaton, the women probably in one part and the men in another,
for a wall divided the East from the West abaton; but, as I
have already pointed out, not more than 120 could find beds
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
there at a time; perhaps the invalid was only housed there at
first, and when he began to improve was drafted off to a hostel.
Assuming that all the buildings which I have suggested to be
hostels were such, they could not accommodate more than
some four or five hundred patients. Perhaps we may assume
that such was the usual number attending at ordinary times, while
at the great festivals many thousands assembled. Whether this
large number were lodged in tents or temporary wooden
buildings, or otherwise, is uncertain.</p>
<p>Probably multitudes of vigorous and able-bodied persons
came to the festivals, and many of them may have been lodged
six miles away at the town of Epidauros, or in villages or
hamlets adjacent. The ten or twelve thousand who filled the
Theatre or the Stadium cannot have been exclusively sick people.
It seems probable that numbers of athletes and multitudes of
Greeks who merely wanted a holiday and a little excitement
came to the Megala Asklepieia as they came to the Isthmian or
the Olympic games. Setting aside, therefore, all visitors of
this class, who probably brought gains to the Sanctuary, and
for whom accordingly space was provided in the Theatre,
Stadium, and Hippodrome, I pass on to consider the suppliants
proper.</p>
<p>The patient on arrival probably had an interview with the
priest or other official, and arranged about his accommodation
with one of the Hieromnemones, or other secular person. He
performs certain rites, bathes in the sacred fountain, and offers
sacrifices under the direction of the Pyrophoros; the poor man
gives his cake only, the rich his sheep, pig, or goat, or other
offering in addition. The votive tablets frequently show the
cakes (<span title="popana" class="g">&pi;&#8057;&pi;&alpha;&nu;&alpha;</span>) being presented, or the sheep, pig, or other
animal. Where the ceremonial purification took place is uncertain.
A deep well exists in the eastern abaton. A stone
dropped struck the water in a fraction over three seconds, as I
found after repeated trials. The well is therefore over 144
feet deep. Possibly the water used in the ritual was derived
hence, but more probably the place of purification has yet to be
found. &ldquo;Only pure souls may enter here,&rdquo; was inscribed over
the entrance of the temple of Asklepios.</p>
<p>Pausanias speaks of a fountain beautifully roofed and decorated,
&ldquo;<span title="kr&ecirc;n&ecirc; t&ocirc; te oroph&ocirc; kai kosm&ocirc; t&ocirc; loip&ocirc; theas axia" class="g">&kappa;&rho;&#8053;&nu;&eta;

&theta;&#8051;&alpha;&sigmaf; &#7936;&xi;&#8055;&alpha;</span>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
Can this have been the bath of Asklepios marked <span class="ss">L</span> in my
plan? Traces of a large basin remain there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>When night comes the sick man brings his bed-clothing
into the abaton, and reposes on his pallet, putting usually some
small gift on the table or altar. The Nakoroi having come
round to light the sacred lamps, the priest enters and recites the
evening prayers to the god, entreating divine help and divine
enlightenment for all the sick assembled there; he then collects
the gifts which had been deposited on altars and tables; later
the Nakoroi enter, put out the lights, enjoin silence, and command
everyone to fall asleep and to hope for guiding visions
from the god. The abaton was a lofty and airy sleeping
chamber, its southern side being an open colonnade. It is
singularly like the &lsquo;shelter balcony&rsquo; or <i>Liegehalle</i>, now used in
treating phthisis. This provision of abundance of pure fresh
air for the sick by day and night, which is so beneficial now,
was undoubtedly so then also, and probably brought much
credit to the god and his shrine.</p>
<p>According to the inscriptions the god frequently appeared
in person, or in visions, speaking to the sick man or woman
concerning their ailments. Whether these visitations were
merely hallucinations in individuals whose imaginations had
been excited, or whether some priest in the dim light, accompanied
by a serpent, acted the part of Asklepios; whether the
patient was put under the influence of opium or some other
drug provocative of dreams; or whether, by some acoustic
trick, the priests caused the sick to hear spoken words which
they attributed to the deity, it is difficult now to say.</p>
<p>The valley of the Hieron was the habitat of a large yellow
serpent, perfectly harmless, and susceptible, like most snakes, of
domestication. Pausanias tells us it is found in the Epidaurian
country alone. I am afraid it is now extinct, though it has
been seen during the present century. A number of these
creatures dwelt in the sanctuary, perhaps in the vaults of the
Tholos. They were reverenced as the incarnation of the god.
The sick were delighted and encouraged when one of these
creatures approached them, and were in the habit of feeding
them with cakes. The serpents seem to have been trained to
lick with their forked tongue any ailing part. The dog also
was sacred to Asklepios, and the temple dogs in like manner
were trained to lick any injured or painful region of the body.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that in the <i>Plutus</i> of Aristophanes,
the blind Plutus enters the abaton of the Asklepieion at
Athens in order to be cured. Asklepios with his daughters,
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Iaso and Panakeia, appear in person; they whistle to the sacred
serpents, which at once approach, lick the blind eyes, and
vision is restored.</p>

<p>In the accompanying sketch of the abaton, <a href="#fig25">Plate XXV</a>, a

<p>Many of the <i>malades imaginaires</i>, who to this day are the
support of the quack, and a cause of embarrassment and
difficulty to the scientific physician&mdash;who desires above all
things to be honest&mdash;doubtless visited Epidauros.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">

<p class="pcap">PLATE XXVI&mdash;<span class="sc">Head of Asklepios</span></p>
</div>
<p>The priest wearing the holy chaplet would take such a
person (as probably he took all suppliants) into the temple, and
cause him to present himself before the image of the god;
libations were poured, prayers and sacrifices offered, and rites
of an impressive kind enacted. Hymns and p&aelig;ans were sung
to the music of the double flute. The sick man was caused to
lay his hand solemnly and reverently on the altar of the god,
and then on the part of his own body presumed to be affected;
if there were really nothing the matter, he was proclaimed to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
miraculously cured by the god, and doubtless his imagination
was so impressed that he often himself believed in the cure.</p>
<p>If the patient were young, sacrifices were doubtless offered
at the shrine of Artemis-Hekate, and perhaps in all cases the
procession of priests and suppliants visited the Tholos (which
you remember was the Thymele or sacrificing place) and offered
sacrifices there perhaps to the serpent, the incarnation of the
god of healing; or the train of votaries ascended Mount
Kynortion to the shrine of the great Apollo.</p>

<p>The suppliants spent the day in rest or exercise, as was
most agreeable to them. It must be remembered that the
precinct was as beautiful as the noblest works of Greek art
could make it; moreover large and lofty trees formed a shady
grove, protecting from the sun&rsquo;s heat, while the soft breeze and
the sweet pure air of the mountains formed in themselves a
potent agency for the restoration of health. The patient had
much around him to please and interest&mdash;beautiful buildings,
rich with sculpture and with colour, statuary figures and groups
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
representing Asklepios and other divinities or subjects from the
old Greek mythology in marble and bronze.</p>
<p><a href="#fig26">Plate XXVI</a> represents a head of Asklepios (from the
Asklepieion at the Pir&aelig;us), to which the genius of the sculptor
has given an expression of sorrow and sympathy, as though the

<p><a href="#fig27">Plate XXVII</a> shows a full-length figure of the god, found
at Epidauros, accompanied as usual by the serpent. Artistic
reliefs, herm&aelig;, and full-length figures of noted priests and

literature, or history; also ex-votos, stel&aelig;, and tablets recording
the marvellous cures effected by the god, coloured bas-reliefs,

<p>Plates <a href="#fig28">XXVIII</a> and <a href="#fig29">XXIX</a> represent the remains of two

<p>Many shrines and chapels to subsidiary deities existed, as,
for example, to Hygieia, Themis, the Egyptian Apollo, Helios,
Selene, Epione (the wife of Asklepios), Zeus, Poseidon, Minerva,
Hera, Demeter and other Eleusinian deities, Dikaiosyne,
Lato, Hypnos, Eileithyia, and others not as yet identified. The
diminutive figure of Telesphoros, in his capacity of god of
Convalescence, is not seen here so often along with Asklepios

<p>Every devout Greek who came as a suppliant to Asklepios

<p>To those who had been initiated at Eleusis, and whose
advanced age or incurable sickness gave little prospect of life,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
the calm and dignified forms of Demeter, Persephone, and
Iakchos would suggest patience and the hope of a pure spiritual
after-life, free from all bodily infirmity, &ldquo;for the Greek or

<p>Those of the sick who were not too ill, would ascend the
hill of Kynortion to visit the temple of Apollo, or climb the
neighbouring hill of Titthion, sacred to the infancy of Asklepios.
Others would engage in the exercises of the gymnasium or the
stadium; if unable to participate in these more active pursuits,
they would become spectators of them. The comedies or
tragedies played in the theatre would often so immerse the
audience in merriment or pathos as to banish for the time
individual troubles; both priest and patient attended them
constantly. Music, the singing of Orpheic hymns, religious
dances, processions, and festivals would vary the interest and
occupations of the day. The studious man could occupy
himself with manuscripts from the library, and, reposing in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
shelter-seats, would dream over history, plays, or poetry. The
solemn rites of the temple, the sacrifices, the study of the
multitudinous tablets, would all tend to a calm and hopeful
condition of mind, eminently helpful to recovery from slight
forms of illness, even though no direct medical treatment were
pursued.</p>
<p>In earlier times it seems as though the health-restoring
influence of the shrines was thought to be wholly miraculous,
with but small aid or none from art: the god alone achieved
all. The more ancient inscriptions contain childishly absurd
reports of miraculous cures.</p>
<p>The ruling idea was that the deity appeared to the sick
man in the abaton, applied some medicament, performed some
operation, or instructed the dreaming patient to carry out some
sanative action when he awoke. The frauds of the god or his
priest were so outrageous that some of the old Greeks seem
almost to have equalled in folly and credulity the moderns, who
readily buy soap or pills on no other warranty than the
advertisements of a lying and interested vendor.</p>
<p>On the walls of the eastern abaton were fixed two large
stone tablets, bearing the title, &ldquo;Cures by Apollo and Asklepios.&rdquo;
Most of the fragments of these tablets have been recovered,
pieced together, and deciphered by M. Cavvadias and other
learned pal&aelig;ographers. The following are a few extracts:&mdash;</p>
<p>Line 72 of the first tablet in the abaton.&mdash;A man who had
only one eye is visited by the god in the abaton during the
night. The god applies an ointment to the empty orbit. On
awaking, the man finds he has two sound eyes.</p>
<p>Line 125.&mdash;Thyson of Hermione is blind of both eyes; a
temple dog licks the organs and he immediately regains his
sight.</p>
<p>Line 107.&mdash;Hermodicos of Lampsacus comes to the
Hieron in a paralyzed condition. As he sleeps in the abaton
the god tells him to rise, to walk outside the precinct, and
carry back into it the largest stone he can find. He does so,
and brings in a stone so heavy that no other man can lift it,
and the stone, as the inscription says, still lies before the
abaton. The same stone (probably) lies there to-day, and the
visitor may yet in vain emulate the feat of Hermodicos. It
will be recognised in the illustration, <a href="#fig31">Plate XXXI</a>, by the hole
cut in it to put the hands in.</p>
<p>Line 113.&mdash;A man had his foot lacerated by the bite of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
wild beast; he is in much pain; the servants of the abaton carry
him outside during the daytime; as he is waiting to be healed a
serpent follows him, licks his foot, and he is at once cured.</p>
<p>Line 122.&mdash;Heraieus of Mytilene has no hair on his head;
he asks the god to make it grow again. Asklepios applies an
ointment, and next morning the hair has grown thickly over
his scalp. (Unfortunately Asklepios omitted to write down
the prescription for the benefit of those in like case in the
future!)</p>

<p class="pcap">PLATE XXXI&mdash;<span class="sc">The Stone miraculously carried by the paralyzed Hermodicos</span></p>
</div>
<p>At line 48 begins a story containing a moral which the
priests may have thought it desirable to impress upon their
visitors:&mdash;</p>
<p>Pandaros comes all the way from Thessaly in order to have
a disfiguring eruption or branding mark on his forehead cured;
he is quickly made well. Returning to Thessaly his cure is
observed by his neighbour Echedoros, who has a similar, but
slighter, eruption on the face. He also goes to Hieron,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
carrying with him a sum of money sent to the god by the
grateful Pandaros. Echedoros contemplates retaining this
money himself; he consults the god about his own case, and in
answer to a question states that he has brought no gift from
Pandaros. On rising in the morning he finds that, instead of
having his skin disease cured, that of Pandaros has been added
to it.</p>
<p>Line 96.&mdash;A man from Toron&oelig;a is so unfortunate as not
to be in the good graces of his stepmother; she introduces a
number of leeches into the wine he drinks. Being of a submissive
and confiding temperament, he swallows the beverage
unsuspectingly, but the results are so serious that he is obliged
to visit the god. Asklepios cuts open his chest with a knife,
removes the leeches, sews up the chest again, and the patient
returns home next day.</p>
<p>From other inscriptions we find that Asklepios treats
dropsy surgically, in a simple but heroic manner; he first cuts
off the patient&rsquo;s head, then holds him up by the heels; the fluid
all runs out. He then puts the patient&rsquo;s head on again, and
the case terminates happily.</p>
<p>These, I think, are a sufficient sample of the preposterous
stories of cures which the god was reported to have performed
in early times.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that the absolute liking which many men
and women have for the charlatan, and for deception, their
appetites for the marvellous and incredible in all medical
matters, existed as strongly among the Greeks as among
ourselves, though the superstitious beliefs and the ignorance
of science prevailing in those times rendered such folly more
excusable than it is now.</p>
<p>In later times it seems clear that superstition and deception
had a less share, and art a larger one, in the work of healing
at Hieron. Probably among the acute citizens of Athens, at no
period were the frauds of the god so outrageous as in the early
times at Hieron. We find the priests prescribing many things
that were prudent and judicious; diet of a plain and simple
character, hot and cold baths, poulticing for certain chest
ailments, and a variety of medicaments&mdash;hemlock juice, oxide
of iron, hellebore, squills, lime-water, and drugs for the allaying
of pain&mdash;are incidentally mentioned. Water was used extensively
both internally and externally; active gymnastic exercise,
riding, friction of the skin, a sort of massage, and counter-irritation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The tablet of Apellas of Idria tells us that when visiting the
Hieron on account of frequent illness and severe indigestion,
the god or his priests ordered a diet of bread and curdled milk,
with parsley and lettuce, lemons boiled in water, also milk and
honey. Apellas being an irascible person, the god ordered careful
avoidance of the emotion of anger, and desired him to run
and swing in the gymnasium, and use vigorous friction and
counter-irritation to the surface of the body. Probably Apellas
was a wealthy and luxurious city-dweller, who took too much
food and Chian wine, and who suffered, as many in that age
did, from gout. He is eventually cured, and erects a tablet to
show his gratitude.</p>
<p>Here is the invocation of another sufferer coming to the
Hieron: &ldquo;O blessed Asklepios, god of healing, it is thanks to
thy skill that Diophantes hopes to be relieved from his incurable
and horrible gout, no longer to move like a crab, no longer to
walk upon thorns, but to have a sound foot as thou hast decreed.&rdquo;
It would have been interesting to know how far Diophantes&rsquo;
hopes were realized. If they met with disappointment, he may
have regretted putting up the tablet at so early a stage.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that many of the sick benefited
greatly by the rest, the pure air, the simple diet, the sources
of mental interest, the baths, exercise, massage, and friction,
and in later days by the actual medical treatment adopted.
Surgical treatment was also employed, for we find marble
reliefs of surgical instruments.</p>
<p>Not infrequently it would happen that persons with real
or with incurable diseases came to Hieron and got worse, notwithstanding
their sacrifices and petitions to the god. How
the priests excused the impotency of their deity on these
occasions we do not know; perhaps some lack of merit, purity,
or sanctity in the individual may have been imputed. We
know that in some cases the honour of Asklepios was saved by
sending the unfortunate invalid to some distant shrine; but of
course it happened that in some instances the patient died while
at the Hieron. Now, according to the religion of the Greeks,
two events were considered to desecrate in the most dreadful
manner any hallowed precinct&mdash;namely, birth and death;
neither of these must occur within any sacred enclosure.</p>
<p>While the sick probably met with considerable kindliness,
humanity, and real help at these shrines, and much actual
benefit resulted, notwithstanding the superstition on which all
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
was based, still, in this one respect Greek tradition and ceremonial
were a cause of the most gross inhumanity. The
unhappy visitant whose vital powers were finally declining was
received and domiciled in the abaton, but when he failed to
improve, and was seen by the priests and attendants to be
obviously dying, instead of being tenderly nursed and soothed,
he was removed from his couch, dragged across the precinct to
the nearest gate, expelled, and left to die on the hillside
unhelped and untended. Asklepios had rejected him, and no
priest or minister of the god must defile himself by any dealings
with death. One cannot but hope that the sympathy and
humanity which exist naturally in the hearts of most men and
of all women, found some means of helping these unhappy
beings, and that when death seemed probable such sufferers
were conveyed to a hostel outside the precinct, and allowed to
die in peace there. A like superstition existed regarding birth.
Many a poor woman who was anticipating maternity, and who
had been hoping for relief from some ordinary ailment, was
suddenly and mercilessly expelled from the precinct at the
moment when she needed help and comfort most.</p>
<p>Not until the time of the Antonines was any definite
provision made for these two classes of sufferers. Either
Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius erected outside the precinct
a home for the dying, and a sort of maternity hospital.
Doubtless some of the ruins dating from the Roman period,
which are at present unidentified, subserved these two purposes.</p>
<p>As yet nothing has been said about the commissariat
arrangements of the Hieron. It is probable that several
hundred persons habitually resided there, if we include the sick,
the convalescents, the priests, officials, and servants, while on
the occasion of the great festivals the number rose to at least
ten or twelve thousand. What arrangements were made for
the dieting of all these? Where were the storehouses, the
kitchen and the &ldquo;deipneterion,&rdquo; or dining-room, if any such
existed?</p>
<p>Probably the diet of the poorer patients may have consisted
largely of the barley-meal paste, the &ldquo;maza&rdquo; eaten with certain
inexpensive vegetables. This would require little preparation.
Among the well-to-do patients, however, who were numerous,
the meals would be more formal and would need more care in
preparation. In early times the &ldquo;ariston&rdquo; formed the breakfast,
and was eaten at sunrise. In later times this meal was moved
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
on to the middle of the day, and the &ldquo;acratisma,&rdquo; consisting
merely of bread dipped in unmixed wine, was eaten at an early
hour. The mid-day meal in later times consisted of various
warm dishes needing the art of the cook, and the principal
meal, the &ldquo;deipnon,&rdquo; which was still more elaborate, was just
before sunset. Where the preparation and the consumption of
these meals took place it is difficult to say.</p>
<p>The lower story of the western abaton may have been a
storehouse, or possibly a kitchen. It must be remembered
that the main part of the flesh of the animals presented for
sacrifice was used for food. In general only the thigh bones,
the entrails and some of the fat, was consumed on the altar, the
remainder was eaten by priests, votaries, or attendants. In the
case of the bloodless offerings, the cakes, fruit, grain, milk, wine,
honey, &amp;c., a large part also was used as food. A rule existed
at Epidauros that all should be consumed within the precinct.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;Square building&rdquo; marked <i>K</i> in the plan,
may have been the scene both of minor sacrifices and of the
consumption of the unsacrificed remnants. I have suggested
above that this building might be a hostel, and the large
quantities of ash, of bones, and of fragments of bronze and
earthenware vessels found there to some extent support this
hypothesis, and the idea that it was employed for the sacrificial
banquets.</p>
<p>Among the hundreds of inscriptions found I have thus far
only mentioned one class&mdash;namely, those referring to cures.
There are, in addition, no fewer than thirteen other kinds of
inscriptions; for example, the great poem of Isyllos, describing
the genealogy and miracles of Asklepios, written by command
of the oracle of Delphi. This has been edited and commented
on in a most scholarly manner by Prof. von Wilamowitz-M&ouml;llendorff.</p>
<p>Many of the inscriptions are in honour of individual
priests, pyrophoroi, hieromnemones, or of distinguished
Greeks unconnected with the sanctuaries; for example there
was found, in association with a headless statue, the inscription
shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#fig32">Plate XXXII</a>. The upper four lines of the inscription are
in the Dorian dialect, the remainder in the Ionian. The former
is the dedication of the statue by the Epidaurians to a historian
previously unknown to the classical student, a certain Philippos
of Pergamos. The lower Ionic fragment is probably a quotation
(the only one known to exist) from his writings.</p>

<p>It is somewhat interesting to find the Boule of Epidauros
thus doing special honour to a historian, and at the same time
warning the Greek people against those political faults to which
the nation was specially prone. The governing bodies of our
health resorts do not show so large-minded an appreciation of
letters or of political morals.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>A number of the later inscriptions are in honour of distinguished
Romans.</p>
<p>There are numerous inscriptions regarding laws, or judicial
decrees. Others, again, refer to the contests of the Stadium,
while another and especially voluminous class relates to the
construction of the temples and other buildings. In addition to
the names of the architects and contractors, and the sums paid,
these records contain many interesting details, <i>e.g.</i>, the statement
that the pediment groups and acroteria on the temple of
Asklepios were cut in marble by Hektoridas and another
artificer, from models designed by the great sculptor Timotheus,
the artist who, along with Scopas, designed parts of the
mausoleum of Halicarnassus.</p>
<p>The minute details concerning the building of the Tholos,
the amounts paid for marble and other materials, the names of
architects and contractors, the report of the commissioners who
inspected the work, and who formed a sort of lay buildings
committee; their journeys to Athens, Corinth, Megara, and
other places in quest of material, workmen, etc., the exact sums
expended on these journeys, and other details, are curious and
interesting. One can only regret that no hint is given of the
use and purpose of the building on which so much care and
thought were expended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>I might occupy much time in showing and describing the
scores of sculptured votive tablets which have been recovered.
In most, of course, the figure of Asklepios has been destroyed
or damaged by the iconoclastic zeal of the early Christian.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">

<p class="pcap">PLATE XXXIII&mdash;<span class="sc">Group of Suppliants approaching Asklepios and his Family</span><a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In <a href="#fig33">Plate XXXIII</a> an almost uninjured example is shown.
A group of four suppliants with their children approach the
god, who leans on his staff with entwining serpent. Behind
Asklepios is seen the head of (probably) his wife Epione, then
come Machaon and Podalirius, his sons, then, probably Hygieia,
Panakeia, and Iaso, his daughters. The whole Asklepian family
are of heroic stature.</p>
<p>Every fourth year a great festival was held at the Hieron,
the Megala Asklepieia, at which athletic contests, races, processions,
music, plays in the theatre, holy (perhaps also unholy)
vigils, lasting all night (especially if the Thracian Kotyttia
were enacted in the portico of Kotys), gorgeous rites, sacrifices,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
decoration of the temples and precincts, together with feasts,
took place. Most probably the priests would arrange for the
performance of a few miracles. Other festivals were also held,
as the Megala Apolloneia.</p>
<p>On these occasions, if not at other times, doubtless every
seat in the theatre, stadium, and hippodrome would be filled,
mostly by sound and healthy visitors, coming, as I have suggested
above, partly to enjoy a holiday, partly to witness athletic
exercises, which interested them quite as much as important
cricket, football, or rowing contests interest us, and partly to
do honour to the god whose aid they might need when the
days of sickness or old age should come.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Lastly, there is a link which, though of no practical import,
is still a genuine historic bond connecting the Hieron of Epidauros
with the medicine of Western Europe. Three centuries
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> Rome was visited by dire pestilence. The rulers of Rome,
having in vain endeavoured to check it, sought the counsel of the
Sybilline books, and were directed to bring Asklepios to Rome
from Epidauros. A galley was sent to the Saronic Gulf, and a
mission visited the Hieron, bringing back to the ship one of
the sacred serpents. The galley returned, entered the Tiber,
approached Rome, and as it touched the insula in the Tiber the
sacred serpent at once left the ship and found a refuge on the
island. From that moment the plague is said to have rapidly
disappeared.</p>
<p>In gratitude to the god, who was thus visibly among them
in serpent form, the south end of the island&mdash;probably, indeed,
the whole of the island&mdash;was modelled into the shape of a great
galley of hewn stone. A temple of &AElig;sculapius (as the Romans
called him) was built at the southern end, with portico and
abaton. A well existing there became sacred to &AElig;sculapius,
and from that day to this the island in the Tiber has, through
pagan and Christian times alike, been devoted to the cure and
treatment of the sick. The stern of the stone galley still
exists, with the effigy of the serpent and remains of the image
of &AElig;sculapius. The Church of St. Bartholomew stands on the
site of the temple, and on or near the spot where stood the
ancient abaton now stands a hospital served by the Brotherhood
of San Juan de Dios, the benevolent saint of Granada, where
the sick folk of Rome are helped and tended; and there, unlike
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
their predecessors of 2,200 years ago, if illness should terminate
in death, the poor weary souls are kindly and tenderly
ministered to by priest, physician, and nurse, until they sink
into the last sleep.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It is doubtless in consequence of this episode of the founding
of a temple of &AElig;sculapius on the island of the Tiber that
the staff and serpent of the Epidaurian god have been, and
remain to this day, the symbol of the profession of Medicine.</p>
